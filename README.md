## **Customer Churn Prediction**

Data set source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadshahidazeem/customer-churn-dataset/data

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks related to the analysis and modeling of customer churn data. The notebooks are:

1. Customer Churn EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
2. Customer Churn Data Modeling

Both notebooks are part of a project to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques.

### **Customer Churn EDA**

This notebook focuses on the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the customer churn dataset. The goals of this notebook are:

1. To understand the structure and characteristics of the data.
2. To identify patterns, correlations, and insights that can inform the modeling process.
3. To perform data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for modeling.

### **Customer Churn Data Modeling**

This notebook builds on the insights gained from the EDA notebook and focuses on creating and evaluating machine learning models to predict customer churn.

Key techniques covered:
1. Sequential Feature Selection (Forward) for feature selection
2. Logistics Regression
3. Random Forest with hyperparameter tuning
4. Random Forest with Threshold tuning
